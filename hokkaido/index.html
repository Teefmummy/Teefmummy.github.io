			<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a></h1>
			<p>Hokkaido (北海道 Hokkaidō) literally "Northern Sea Circuit", formerly known as Ezo, Yezo, Yeso, or Yesso, is Japan's second largest island; it is also the largest and northernmost of Japan's 47 prefectures. The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaido from Honshu, although the two islands are connected by the underwater railway Seikan Tunnel. The largest city on Hokkaido is its capital, Sapporo, which is also its only ordinance-designated city.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Ishikari-nabe is a typical dish of Hokkaido, making use of fresh salmon from head to tail. The name comes from the Ishikari-gawa River, famed for its salmon catch, and the same dish is known as tokachi-nabe in the Obihiro area. Chunks of salmon are stewed with vegetables, tofu and konnyaku (devil's tongue) in kelp stock flavored with miso. </p><p class="hidden-text-food" style="display: none;">Locally produced potatoes and cabbage add to the delicious flavor of this hearty dish, so you can indulge in the tastes of Hokkaido from both the sea and the land. The origin of ishikari-nabe is a salmon and vegetable stew cooked by the Ainu people in the 17-18th centuries, with miso introduced with the arrival of Japanese people from the south.</p>

			<p>Hokkaido is the birthplace of beer in Japan. Sapporo Beer, one of the oldest and most popular beer brands in the country, has been brewed in Sapporo since 1877 and is now produced and sold around the world. The Sapporo Breweries opened the Sapporo Beer Museum in 1987 in a former brewery from the Meiji Period. The museum introduces the history of beer in Japan and the process of beer making, but has few explanations in English. After the exhibitions, beer tastings are available at a small fee.</p>
			<p class="hidden-text" style="display: none;">Next to the museum is the Sapporo Beer Garden, which consists of two restaurants. A relaxing meal can be enjoyed at the Garden Grill restaurant, while the Genghis Khan Hall is an atmospheric beer hall that offers all you can drink beer and all you can eat mutton BBQ, a popular local dish named after the great Mongolian ruler (Jingisukan in Japanese). For guests with more moderate appetites, items at the Genghis Khan Hall can also be ordered from the menu individually.</p>
