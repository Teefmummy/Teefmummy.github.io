			<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABgoku_region">Chugoku</a></h1>
			<p>The Chūgoku region (中国地方 Chūgoku-chihō?), also known as the San'in-San'yō region (山陰山陽地方 San'in san'yō-chihō?), is the westernmost region of Honshū, the largest island of Japan. It consists of the prefectures of Hiroshima, Okayama, Shimane, Tottori and Yamaguchi.[2] In 2010 it had a population of 7,563,428.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Fugu sashimi is sliced so thin that you can see the pattern of the plate through the neatly arranged slices. It is exquisite to look at and the taste of the delicate white meat is exceptionally good. Puffer fish is also enjoyed as a pan dish called fuguchiri, or as hire-zake (a sake drink with dried puffer fish fin).</p><p class="hidden-text-food" style="display: none;">Puffer fish are cute in appearance, but there are some types that contain a deadly poison called tetrodotoxin. People who cook puffer fish are required to have a special license. Licensed cooks are trained to carefully remove the poisonous parts, so it is perfectly safe to eat when prepared by them. The taste of puffer fish has long captured the hearts of the Japanese people.</p>

				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/GenbakuDome02.jpg" alt="Peace Memorial Dome">
			</div>
			<p>The Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome) is the only structure left standing near the hypocenter of the first atomic bomb which exploded on 6 August 1945, and it remains in the condition right after the explosion. Through the efforts of many people, including those of the city of Hiroshima, this ruin has been preserved in the same state as immediately after the bombing. Not only is it a stark and powerful symbol of the most destructive force ever created by humankind, it also expresses the hope for world peace and the ultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons. The inscribed property covers 0.40 ha in the urban centre of Hiroshima and consists of the surviving Genbaku Dome (“Genbaku” means atomic bomb in Japanese) within the ruins of the building. The 42.7 ha buffer zone that surrounds the property includes the Peace Memorial Park.</p>
			<p class="hidden-text" style="display: none;">The most important meaning of the surviving structure of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial is in what it symbolizes, rather than just its aesthetic and architectural values. This silent structure is the skeletal form of the surviving remains of the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall (constructed in 1914). It symbolizes the tremendous destructive power, which humankind can invent on the one hand; on the other hand, it also reminds us of the hope for world permanent peace.</p>
