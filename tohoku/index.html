			<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dhoku_region">Tohoku</a></h1>
			<p>The Tōhoku region (東北地方 Tōhoku-chihō) consists of the northeastern portion of Honshu, the largest island of Japan. This traditional region consists of six prefectures (ken): Akita, Aomori, Fukushima, Iwate, Miyagi and Yamagata.
			Tōhoku retains a reputation as a remote, scenic region with a harsh climate. In the 20th century, tourism became a major industry in the Tōhoku region.</p>

			<h2>Famous Cuisine</h2>

			</div>
			<p>A popular traditional cuisine of Akita is kiritanpo, usually eaten during mid-September to March, but particularly in November when gluten cakes from newly harvested rice arrive on the market. Kiritanpo is cooked rice that is kneaded and then toasted on a skewer. It is then cut into 5-cm lengths and cooked in a pan with burdock, Chinese leeks, maitake mushrooms and other seasonal vegetables as well as Japanese parsley and chicken. </p><p class="hidden-text-food" style="display: none;">You must experience this unique taste from Akita. Originally designed as a portable meal carried by woodcutters and hunters working in the mountains, its name comes from its shape, which resembles a tanpo-yari (leather spearhead sheath enclosing a cloth ball filled with cotton).</p>

			<h2>Famous Attractions</h2>

				<img src="http://japansnowaccommodation.com/images/Sukayu_Onsen_Johannes_2.jpg" alt="big cold pool">
			</div>
			<p>Sukayu Onsen is a little different from your average hot spring. After a long drive through a twisting and turning mountain pass, a parking lot opens up with several large wooden old buildings and something in the air. And that something stinks! The whole place smells like putrid rotten eggs. The smell comes from sulfur, a natural mineral found in areas with volcanic activity. Why were there so many cars at a place that smelled so bad? The sulfur in the hot water has several health benefits and helps sooth a tired body. On top of that, besides being known as the “1000-person hot spring” for its great size, it is a rarity among hot spring resorts in Japan because both sexes use the same pool at the same time!</p>
			<p class="hidden-text" style="display: none;">After performing the hot spring etiquette of undressing, washing, and rinsing off, you can enter the main room, using a towel for modesty. There are two large pools for bathing as well as the expected cool pools and places to shower. A thick steam fills the room, but at least the smell of eggs will seem to disappear at this point. Find a place to settle in and soak in the view.</p>
