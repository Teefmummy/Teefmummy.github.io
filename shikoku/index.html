			<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku">Shikoku</a></h1>
			<p>Shikoku (四国, "four provinces") is the smallest (225 km or 139.8 mi long and between 50 and 150 km or 31.1 and 93.2 mi wide) and least populous (4,141,955 as of 2005) of the four main islands of Japan, located south of Honshu and east of the island of Kyushu. Its ancient names include Iyo-no-futana-shima (伊予之二名島), Iyo-shima (伊予島), and Futana-shima (二名島). The current name refers to the four former provinces that made up the island: Awa, Tosa, Sanuki, and Iyo.</p>

			<p>Bonito is a very popular fish in Japan and nobori-katsuo (bonito swimming north) is highly prized. The Tosa area in Kochi is famous for its good quality bonito, which is actually designated as the official fish of the prefecture. They are tasty when eaten as sashimi and are the main ingredient in sawachi, a traditional dish in Tosa.</p><p class="hidden-text-food" style="display: none;">Another famous dish is tataki (lightly roasted bonito). The bonito fillet is roasted lightly till it becomes golden in color, but it should still be raw in the center. As soon as it is roasted, you put it in cold water and drain it quickly. Then you eat it with leeks, ginger, Japanese basil or garlic by dipping it in ponzu sauce (pressed from a bitter orange).</p>

			</div>
			<p>Marugame Castle (丸亀城, Marugamejō), also known as Kameyama Castle, is a hilltop castle in Marugame City. Situated high up on steep stone walls, the castle has a commanding view of the city below and overlooks one of the narrowest parts of the Seto Inland Sea, a feature which afforded it control over the main shipping lanes of the region. Marugame Castle is one of only twelve castles remaining in Japan that have survived the post feudal ages (since 1868) with their keep buildings intact.</p>
			<p class="hidden-text" style="display: none;">Marugame Castle was originally constructed from 1597 to 1602 by Ikoma Chikamasa, the feudal lord who also built Tamamo Castle in nearby Takamatsu. However, due to a new policy by the shogun that limited the number of castles per province to just one, Marugame Castle was torn down again just 13 years after its completion. The castle was rebuilt in 1660 after the province had been split into two. Over the centuries many of the castle buildings were destroyed by fires, and now only the original keep and several of the castle gates remain.</p>
