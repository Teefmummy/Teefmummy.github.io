			<p>The Chubu Region (中部地方, Chūbu Chihō, literally "central part") consists of nine prefectures and is located in the center of Japan's largest island Honshu.

			The northern part of the Chubu Region along the Sea of Japan coast (Fukui, Ishikawa, Toyama) is also known as Hokuriku Region, while the southern part (Shizuoka, Aichi, Gifu) is also known as Tokai Region and the prefectures of Yamanashi, Nagano and Niigata as the Koshinetsu Region.</p>

			<p>Lake Hamana-ko where freshwater and seawater mix together is famous for the cultivation of eels. They are highly nutritious and one custom observed in Japan is to eat them in summer, when people tend to lose their appetite because of the heat and humidity. Among the various ways to enjoy eating eels, the most popular is kabayaki (charcoal-broiled eel).</p><p class="hidden-text-food" style="display: none;">In the Kanto area, eel fillets are roasted over charcoal and are steamed once, after which they are roasted again over medium heat while basting. In the Kansai area, a whole gutted eel is roasted on a skewer while basting. Una-ju or una-don with roasted eel on a bed of hot cooked rice covered with basting sauce is very popular regardless of the season. Many restaurants in the Lake Hamana-ko area feature these dishes on the menu.</p>

			<p>Fuji-Q Highland (富士急ハイランド) is a major amusement park located in the Fuji Five Lakes region at the foot of Mount Fuji. One of Japan's most popular theme parks, Fuji-Q Highland is best known for its thrilling, record holding roller coasters and elaborate, anime themed rides and attractions. The park strives to be at the forefront of theme park entertainment, and has been constantly opening new rides and attractions, including Guinness World Record breaking roller coasters.</p>
			<p class="hidden-text" style="display: none;">Currently, the park has four major roller coasters.

Dodonpa (2001) is currently the parks speediest coaster and the world record holder for fastest acceleration. Eejanaika (2006), a "4th dimension" roller coaster with seats rotating within the car, has the most inversions of any roller coaster.
