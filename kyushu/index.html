			<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu">Kyushu</a></h1>
			<p>Kyushu (九州 Kyūshū, lit. "Nine Provinces") is the third largest island of Japan and most southwesterly of its four main islands. Its alternate ancient names include Kyūkoku (九国, "Nine States"), Chinzei (鎮西, "West of the Pacified Area"), and Tsukushi-no-shima (筑紫島, "Island of Tsukushi"). The historical regional name Saikaidō (西海道, lit. West Sea Circuit) referred to Kyushu and its surrounding islands.
			In the 8th century Taihō Code reforms, Dazaifu was established as a special administrative term for the region.
			As of 2006, Kyushu has a population of 13,231,995 and covers 35,640 square kilometres (13,760 sq mi).</p>

			<p>The second most popular alcoholic beverage of Japan is shochu, which is categorized into two types according to the distillation method. One is honkaku shochu, (authentic shochu), which includes extracted flavor compounds in addition to alcohol made through the classic production method. It has a rustic taste and flavor from ingredients such as wheat, sweet potatoes, buckwheat or black sugar.</p><p class="hidden-text-food" style="display: none;">In Kagoshima and Miyazaki in the Kyushu area, much of the imo-jochu is produced from sweet potatoes. The potato shochu from Kagoshima is satsuma shochu, which has a long history going back to the Muromachi Period (1333-1573), confirmed by the recent discovery of documentary evidence. Potato shochu has a unique flavor and sweetness and is a popular drink with either ice or hot water. You can enjoy the original straight taste and coolness of this drink with ice, while hot water brings out its rich flavor and sweetness. It is fun to change the way you drink it according to the season.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Kumamoto Castle (Kumamoto-jo) is one of the most famous castles of Japan, along with Himeji and Nagoya Castles. It was built by the daimyo Kato Kiyomasa, who governed this region, at the beginning of the 17th century. The previous castle had been small, and it took about seven years beginning in 1601 to complete.</p>
			<p class="hidden-text" style="display: none;">The site measures roughly 1.6 km east to west and 1.2 km north to south, including structures such as the donjon and other buildings. The stone walls of the castle tower are 13.5 m tall and the donjon itself is 30.29 m tall. The donjon is of a complex and solid construction. The structure of the stone walls is held in very high regard. The buildings were damaged by frequent fires, but 13 of them, such as the turrets, retain their original form and have been designated Important Cultural Properties.</p>
